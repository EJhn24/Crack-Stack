                  lasting impression.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>III. Practical Applications</strong><br />
                  The insights gained from the seminar can be applied in
                  practical scenarios such as creating personal branding for job
                  applications or freelance projects. By integrating design

                  <strong>IV. Positive Feedback on Organization</strong><br />
                  The event was well-organized, with clear communication and a
                  conducive environment for learning. Mr. Bautista’s expertise
                  and engaging delivery made the session informative and
                  inspiring. The seminar successfully balanced theoretical

                    >"The Importance of Version Control in System Development
                    and Thesis Project"</em
                  >
                  will be held on <strong>November 7, 2024</strong>, from
                  <strong>2:30 PM to 3:30 PM</strong> in Room 520 at
                  <strong>Gordon College Campus</strong>, Olongapo City. Led by
                  <strong>Mr. Ralph Angelo Jaminal</strong>, the event is

                <p>
                  <strong>II. Learnings and Reflections</strong><br />
                  The seminar highlighted the significance of version control
                  systems, emphasizing how tools like GitHub can streamline
                  collaboration and manage complex projects effectively. I
                  learned that version control is not just a technical
                  requirement but a foundational skill in system development and
                  thesis projects. Concepts such as branching, committing
                  changes, resolving merge conflicts, and maintaining a clear
                  repository history were explained with practical examples. Mr.
                  Jaminal’s insights helped demystify GitHub's intimidating
                  interface, making it accessible even for beginners.
                  Additionally, I gained a better understanding of how version
                  control ensures accountability and traceability in projects,
                  allowing developers to backtrack and identify specific
                  changes. The importance of maintaining organized repositories
                  for future scalability and team collaboration was also
                  emphasized, which I found particularly relevant for thesis
                  work that often involves group dynamics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>III. Practical Applications</strong><br />
                  I plan to incorporate version control into my thesis project
                  immediately. Using GitHub will enable my team to collaborate
                  more efficiently, avoid redundant work, and minimize conflicts
                  during code integration. By setting up a shared repository and
                  assigning clear responsibilities, we can ensure a structured
                  workflow. On a broader level, the knowledge gained from the
                  seminar can also be applied to internships or freelance
                  projects, where version control is often a standard practice.
                  Maintaining a personal GitHub portfolio can serve as a
                  valuable asset in showcasing my skills and completed projects
                  to potential employers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>IV. Positive Feedback on Organization</strong><br />
                  The seminar was well-organized, with a clear agenda and a
                  speaker who was both knowledgeable and engaging. The use of
                  live demonstrations made the session interactive and easy to
                  follow. The inclusion of practical examples and real-world
                  applications of GitHub was particularly commendable, as it
                  bridged the gap between theory and practice. The allotted time
                  was used effectively, leaving room for a brief Q&A session,
                  which clarified many doubts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>V. Suggestions for Improvement</strong><br />
                  The seminar was informative, but future sessions could benefit
                  from hands-on activities for managing GitHub repositories and
                  more time to cover advanced topics like CI/CD pipelines.
                  Overall, it was a valuable initiative that equipped students
                  with important skills, helping them become more proficient
                  with industry-standard tools.

                      <li>Effective communication of tech ideas is just as important as development.</li>
                      <li>There is always room to learn from others’ innovations and approaches.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <p><strong>III. Practical Application of Learning</strong><br>
                      The conference highlighted the importance of clear documentation, user-centered design, and real-world validation. Moving forward, we plan to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Refine <strong>TricyCall</strong> by improving its UX/UI based on user feedback.</li>
                      <li>Conduct deeper usability testing to ensure the system solves real commuting challenges.</li>

The theme, <em>"Empower, Collaborate, Excel"</em>, was felt throughout—from the talks to the competitions. The balance of academic rigor and inclusivity made the event enjoyable and meaningful.
                    </p>
                
                    <p><strong>V. Suggestions for Future Improvements</strong><br>
                      While the Q&A sessions were helpful, we suggest adding a <strong>hands-on system demonstration</strong> element in future conferences. Allowing judges and attendees to try out the actual systems would:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Provide more authentic and direct feedback.</li>
                      <li>Showcase system functionality more effectively.</li>
                      <li>Help developers identify strengths and usability issues from real interactions.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      For a tech-driven event with capstone projects, interactive evaluation can better highlight the practical value of the participants’ innovations.

                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>III. Practical Applications</strong><br />
                  The insights gained from the seminar can be applied in
                  practical scenarios such as creating personal branding for job
                  applications or freelance projects. By integrating design

                  <strong>IV. Positive Feedback on Organization</strong><br />
                  The event was well-organized, with clear communication and a
                  conducive environment for learning. Mr. Bautista’s expertise
                  and engaging delivery made the session informative and
                  inspiring. The seminar successfully balanced theoretical

                  <strong>2:30 PM to 3:30 PM</strong> in Room 520 at
                  <strong>Gordon College Campus</strong>, Olongapo City. Led by
                  <strong>Mr. Ralph Angelo Jaminal</strong>, the event is designed

                <p>
                  <strong>II. Learnings and Reflections</strong><br />
                  The seminar highlighted the significance of version control
                  systems, emphasizing how tools like GitHub can streamline
                  collaboration and manage complex projects effectively. I learned
                  that version control is not just a technical requirement but a
                  foundational skill in system development and thesis projects.
                  Concepts such as branching, committing changes, resolving merge
                  conflicts, and maintaining a clear repository history were
                  explained with practical examples. Mr. Jaminal’s insights helped
                  demystify GitHub's intimidating interface, making it accessible
                  even for beginners. Additionally, I gained a better
                  understanding of how version control ensures accountability and
                  traceability in projects, allowing developers to backtrack and
                  identify specific changes. The importance of maintaining
                  organized repositories for future scalability and team
                  collaboration was also emphasized, which I found particularly
                  relevant for thesis work that often involves group dynamics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>III. Practical Applications</strong><br />
                  I plan to incorporate version control into my thesis project
                  immediately. Using GitHub will enable my team to collaborate
                  more efficiently, avoid redundant work, and minimize conflicts
                  during code integration. By setting up a shared repository and
                  assigning clear responsibilities, we can ensure a structured
                  workflow. On a broader level, the knowledge gained from the
                  seminar can also be applied to internships or freelance
                  projects, where version control is often a standard practice.
                  Maintaining a personal GitHub portfolio can serve as a valuable
                  asset in showcasing my skills and completed projects to
                  potential employers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>IV. Positive Feedback on Organization</strong><br />
                  The seminar was well-organized, with a clear agenda and a
                  speaker who was both knowledgeable and engaging. The use of live
                  demonstrations made the session interactive and easy to follow.
                  The inclusion of practical examples and real-world applications
                  of GitHub was particularly commendable, as it bridged the gap
                  between theory and practice. The allotted time was used
                  effectively, leaving room for a brief Q&A session, which
                  clarified many doubts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>V. Suggestions for Improvement</strong><br />
                  The seminar was informative, but future sessions could benefit
                  from hands-on activities for managing GitHub repositories and
                  more time to cover advanced topics like CI/CD pipelines.
                  Overall, it was a valuable initiative that equipped students
                  with important skills, helping them become more proficient with
                  industry-standard tools.

                  component of the event was executed efficiently, making it a
                  memorable experience for all attendees.
                </p>

                <p>

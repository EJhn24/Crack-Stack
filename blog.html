                  lasting impression.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>III. Practical Applications</strong><br />
                  The insights gained from the seminar can be applied in
                  practical scenarios such as creating personal branding for job
                  applications or freelance projects. By integrating design

                  <strong>IV. Positive Feedback on Organization</strong><br />
                  The event was well-organized, with clear communication and a
                  conducive environment for learning. Mr. Bautista’s expertise
                  and engaging delivery made the session informative and
                  inspiring. The seminar successfully balanced theoretical

                    >"The Importance of Version Control in System Development
                    and Thesis Project"</em
                  >
                  will be held on <strong>November 7, 2024</strong>, from
                  <strong>2:30 PM to 3:30 PM</strong> in Room 520 at
                  <strong>Gordon College Campus</strong>, Olongapo City. Led by
                  <strong>Mr. Ralph Angelo Jaminal</strong>, the event is

                <p>
                  <strong>II. Learnings and Reflections</strong><br />
                  The seminar highlighted the significance of version control
                  systems, emphasizing how tools like GitHub can streamline
                  collaboration and manage complex projects effectively. I
                  learned that version control is not just a technical
                  requirement but a foundational skill in system development and
                  thesis projects. Concepts such as branching, committing
                  changes, resolving merge conflicts, and maintaining a clear
                  repository history were explained with practical examples. Mr.
                  Jaminal’s insights helped demystify GitHub's intimidating
                  interface, making it accessible even for beginners.
                  Additionally, I gained a better understanding of how version
                  control ensures accountability and traceability in projects,
                  allowing developers to backtrack and identify specific
                  changes. The importance of maintaining organized repositories
                  for future scalability and team collaboration was also
                  emphasized, which I found particularly relevant for thesis
                  work that often involves group dynamics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>III. Practical Applications</strong><br />
                  I plan to incorporate version control into my thesis project
                  immediately. Using GitHub will enable my team to collaborate
                  more efficiently, avoid redundant work, and minimize conflicts
                  during code integration. By setting up a shared repository and
                  assigning clear responsibilities, we can ensure a structured
                  workflow. On a broader level, the knowledge gained from the
                  seminar can also be applied to internships or freelance
                  projects, where version control is often a standard practice.
                  Maintaining a personal GitHub portfolio can serve as a
                  valuable asset in showcasing my skills and completed projects
                  to potential employers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>IV. Positive Feedback on Organization</strong><br />
                  The seminar was well-organized, with a clear agenda and a
                  speaker who was both knowledgeable and engaging. The use of
                  live demonstrations made the session interactive and easy to
                  follow. The inclusion of practical examples and real-world
                  applications of GitHub was particularly commendable, as it
                  bridged the gap between theory and practice. The allotted time
                  was used effectively, leaving room for a brief Q&A session,
                  which clarified many doubts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>V. Suggestions for Improvement</strong><br />
                  The seminar was informative, but future sessions could benefit
                  from hands-on activities for managing GitHub repositories and
                  more time to cover advanced topics like CI/CD pipelines.
                  Overall, it was a valuable initiative that equipped students
                  with important skills, helping them become more proficient
                  with industry-standard tools.

                      <p><strong>I. Event Overview</strong><br>
                        The seminar titled <em>“Navigating the AI-Driven Future: Education, Ethics, and Innovation”</em> was a significant academic discussion held during <strong>RAITE 2024</strong> at <strong>Angeles University Foundation</strong>. This event gathered IT students, educators, and professionals to examine the role of artificial intelligence in reshaping the tech industry, educational practices, and ethical norms. The session emphasized that innovation must be driven by responsibility and purposeful design, especially as AI becomes more embedded in daily life.

                      <p><strong>II. Learnings and Reflections</strong><br>
                        This seminar broadened my perspective on AI, showing that its implications go far beyond coding and automation. I learned that while AI offers tremendous opportunities to enhance learning and support decision-making, it also raises critical concerns such as:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Bias in algorithmic decision-making</li>
                        <li>Data privacy and responsible data use</li>
                        <li>The changing role of human labor in an AI-driven economy</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        One of the most impactful messages was the ethical responsibility developers hold. As future IT professionals, we must ensure that the systems we design serve humanity fairly and transparently. The seminar also introduced ways educators are using AI to personalize learning and reduce administrative workload, underlining how AI can support — not replace — human guidance in education.
                      </p>
                  
                      <p><strong>III. Practical Application of Learning</strong><br>
                        Moving forward, I will adopt a more ethical mindset in developing AI-driven or data-dependent projects. This includes:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Ensuring data privacy through anonymization techniques</li>
                        <li>Maintaining transparency in how algorithms are used or trained</li>
                        <li>Writing fair, inclusive, and unbiased code</li>
                        <li>Exploring open-source AI frameworks that align with ethical standards</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        The seminar motivated me to think more critically about my role in shaping the future of tech — not just as a builder, but as a responsible innovator.
                      </p>
                  
                      <p><strong>IV. Positive Feedback on Event Organization</strong><br>
                        The seminar was well-executed despite the high attendance. The speaker communicated the topic effectively, using relevant real-world examples and applications. I appreciated that the seminar moved beyond the excitement of AI’s capabilities to tackle deeper discussions around its impact on society. This thoughtful balance made the session highly engaging and intellectually rewarding.
                      </p>
                  
                      <p><strong>V. Suggestions for Future Improvements</strong><br>
                        One potential improvement could be the extension of the open forum or Q&A portion. There were many interesting questions, but time constraints limited how deeply they could be explored. I also suggest:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                        <li><strong>Micro-sessions:</strong> Follow-up discussions or workshops focusing on key subtopics, such as AI ethics, would encourage continuous learning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflection Breaks:</strong> Short reflection periods at the end of each segment to reinforce major points.</li>
                        <li><strong>Online Forums:</strong> Create a platform where attendees can continue sharing insights and resources after the seminar.</li>
